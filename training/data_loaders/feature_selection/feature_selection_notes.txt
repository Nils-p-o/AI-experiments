ppo family:
chlo are basically the same for global, so maybe only need one of these (likely c or o)
local chlo 10_20 are very similar too

volatility family:
local price 50+ lookback are very similar for chlo, so maybe only include one
50+ look back of returns does not hav ethat issue, somehow

maybe 3, 7 as additional vol lookbacks (+ 100, 200, 500?)
global price vol seems pointless? (except for volume?)

ema family:
maybe try 3, 7, 15, 50, 200 as lookbacks?

bb family:
maybe exclude 20 and 50 signals? (very similar to local returns, apparently)

fundamentals:
total_equity, local+global pe+pb+pe ratio
some random for volume

time feats:
is_ feats might be useless (is_quarter_..., is_month_..., is_leap_year)
day of year is technically redundant, because of month and day of month
